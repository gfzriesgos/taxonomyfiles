## The building class folder is further divided into:
   - Earthquake schemas
      - SARA schema as given by Yepes-Estrada et al., 2017
      - HAZUS schema as given by ATC-13
      - EMS-98 schema as given by Grunthal 1998
   - Tsunami schemas 
      - Building classes defined by Suppasri et al., 2013 
      - Building classes defined by Charvet et al., 2015 
    - Lahar schemas: 
      Note: The RC buildings are defined by Mavroulli et al., 2017 and Masonry classes are deifned by Zuccaro et al., 2013
        - RIESGOS taxonomy
        Note: The class attributes are considered using the RIESGOS taxonomy 
        - GEM taxonomy
        Note:The class attributes are considered using GEM taxonomy.
        
  ## For each of these building classes a set of trial were performed described in the class name using the extension of '_T#'. 
  ## These trial were performed based on consideration of a combination of weights for different building attributes. A thourough explanation
  ## is given in the project report.
